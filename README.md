# Store Backend
Example backend system for a retail store

### Usage

Running the command `make` within the project directory will compile the executable *store-backend.exe*. Running `make run` will run the program, and running `make clean` will remove *mountain-paths.exe*. Then, *driver.cpp* will allow for a terminal-based interaction in which users can manage a store.
